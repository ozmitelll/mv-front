                <p>One of the advantages of using <span className={'font-bold'}>MV Coin</span> is that several large

                        className={'font-bold'}>MV Coin</span> does not manipulate rates. We are
                    committed to offering customers the most favorable buying and selling conditions. In addition, MV
                    Coin prioritizes maintaining extremely high-speed order execution.
                    <span className={'font-bold'}>MV Coin</span> employs <span className={'font-bold'}>STP (Straight Through Processing)</span> and <span
                        className={'font-bold'}>NDD (No Dealing Desk)</span> order execution
                    principles. This ensures that the total risk for some transactions is automatically redirected to
                    top-tier liquidity providers in real time, similar to practices used by banks and financial
                    institutions. In certain cases, <span className={'font-bold'}>MV Coin</span> may partially assume
                    the transaction risk.
                    Our traders can always be confident that, due to the use of <span className={'font-bold'}>NDD technology</span>,
                    we do not manually

                    requests to trade advertisements created by other users.</p>
                <p>By submitting a request for trading, you agree to the terms of the transaction set by the
                    advertiser—whether by selecting options provided in the ad or by agreeing to custom terms specified
                    in the <span className={'font-bold'}>Terms of Trade</span> field on the advertisement page. These
                    terms are binding unless they:

                <ul className={'list-disc pl-8'}>
                    <li>Violate these <span className={'font-bold'}>Terms of Service</span>.</li>

                    <li>Are modified by mutual agreement between both parties.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The exchange rate, bitcoin quantity, payment window, payment method, and other terms displayed on the
                    advertisement page before a trade request is submitted cannot be changed once trading begins.
                </p>
                <p className={'text-2xl font-semibold'}>Seller’s Responsibility:</p>
                <p>When selling bitcoins, it is your responsibility to:</p>
                <ul className={'list-disc pl-8'}>
                    <li>Confirm that you have received full payment, regardless of the buyer’s payment evidence.
                    </li>
                    <li>Ensure the payment was not made by a third party and complies with your provided instructions.
                    </li>
                    <li>Understand that once the trade is initiated, bitcoins cannot be canceled, disputed, restored, or
                        refunded.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p className={'text-2xl font-semibold'}>Payment Rules:</p>
                <ul className={'list-disc pl-8'}>
                    <li>Payments must be made by the person who registered and owns the account.
                    </li>
                    <li>Payment details provided by merchants must match the name on the <span
                        className={'font-bold'}>MV</span> account.
                    </li>
                    <li>Payments involving third parties or attempts to make such payments violate this Agreement.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p className={'text-2xl font-semibold'}>Communication:</p>
                <p>All communication related to a transaction must occur within the <span
                    className={'font-bold'}>MV</span> trading chat to ensure
                    transparency and accountability.
                </p>
                <ul className={'list-disc pl-8'}>
                    <li>Messages that occur outside the <span
                        className={'font-bold'}>MV</span> chat, or are hidden, encrypted, or inaccessible to <span
                        className={'font-bold'}>MV</span> staff, will not be considered during dispute resolution.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p className={'text-2xl font-semibold'}>Disputes:</p>
                <p>When the buyer and the seller disagree about the transaction, either party or MV Coin can initiate a
                    dispute (“Disputed transaction” or “dispute”) to initiate a mediation process regarding bitcoins
                    held in escrow. Disputed transactions are resolved by MV Coin support staff.</p>
                <p>Disputes can only be started on transactions that are open and marked as paid by the buyer.
                    Transactions that are not marked as paid by the buyer, have been issued by the seller, canceled by
                    the buyer, automatically canceled, or have already been challenged and resolved, are considered
                    completed and cannot be challenged, canceled, or changed.
                </p>
                <p>When you engage in bitcoin trading, it is important that you remain active and accessible from the
                    moment you start trading until it is completed, canceled, or authorized. This means that you must be
                    able to respond to the MV Coin request in disputed trading within 12 hours, otherwise disputes can
                    be resolved against you.
                </p>
                <p>During the dispute, MV Coin support staff can give you instructions that you must follow. These
                    instructions may require you to provide a confirmation of payment, confirmation that you received or
                    did not receive the payment (for example, a history of bank transactions), additional confirmation
                    of identity, photo, audio, or video evidence, or any other documents that MV Coin deems appropriate.
                    Unless otherwise specified by us, these documents must be added to the most controversial
                    transaction. Failure to follow instructions may result in a resolution of the dispute against
                    you.</p>
                <p>Conflict situations are usually resolved by MV Coin staff by the movement of Bitcoin deposited to the
                    buyer or seller of the disputed trade once the dispute resolution criteria are met. In rare
                    situations where either party does not meet the criteria, or for other reasons it is unclear or
                    impossible to determine which party has met the dispute resolution criteria, MV Coin may decide to
                    resolve the dispute by evenly distributing the escrowed bitcoin between the buyer and the seller or
                    unevenly.
                </p>
                <p>MV Coin can resolve a controversial deal for a Bitcoin buyer if one of the following criteria is met:
                    the buyer made payment in accordance with the instructions provided by the seller, the advertising
                    terms of the trade, or the details of the payment for the advertisement, and the buyer provided
                    sufficient evidence that the payment was made in accordance with these instructions, or the seller
                    did not respond.
                </p>
                <p>MV Coin may resolve the controversial transaction to the Bitcoin seller if one of the following
                    criteria is met: the buyer did not provide payment or did not provide payment in full, the buyer is
                    not responding, the payment made by the buyer has been delayed, frozen, or stopped by the payment
                    provider, the buyer did not pay in accordance with the instructions provided to him by the seller in
                    the trading chat, advertising terms, or payment details for the advertisement, or the payment is
                    made by a third party in a transaction or payment is made from a payment account not registered in
                    the name of the buyer.
                </p>
                <p>If the buyer or seller of the disputed trade provides false information or fraudulent documents or
                    makes false statements or otherwise tries to force a certain outcome of the disputed trade, disputes
                    can be resolved immediately against the user.
                </p>
                <p>If you believe that MV Coin has resolved a dispute to which you are a party not in accordance with
                    these conditions, you have the right to request a review. To request a review, you must notify us
                    and, in particular, request a review by contacting customer support no later than 7 days after the
                    dispute is resolved.</p>
                <p className={'text-2xl font-semibold'}>Advertisements:</p>
                <p>You can create advertisements (“advertising”, “advertising” or “advertising”) to advertise that you
                    want to buy or sell bitcoins. Other users can send you trade requests from the ad you created. Once
                    a trade request is sent to you, Bitcoin trading starts automatically.
                </p>
                <p>If you have ads enabled, you must be proactive and prepared to respond to transactions started with
                    these advertisements. If a dispute is initiated in trading with an advertiser who is inactive or
                    inaccessible, the advertiser may be considered unresponsive under this agreement, and the dispute
                    may be resolved against them.</p>
                <p>The information and payment details that you provide in advertisements and tenders must always be
                    correct and relevant. Disputes may be resolved against you if you provide outdated payment details
                    and the buyer completes the payment accordingly. Failure to complete transactions or provide
                    accurate payment details for transactions opened through your advertisement is considered a
                    violation of this agreement.
                </p>
                <p>The pricing defined in the details of the advertisement should include all fees that the advertiser
                    requires from the buyer. Once the transaction has started, the price is locked and cannot be
                    changed, nor can additional fees be added without the consent of both parties to the transaction.
                </p>
                <p className={'text-3xl font-semibold'}>5. Our Fees.</p>
                <p>Services are provided for a fee determined for each transaction and/or in accordance with the prices
                    and pricing principles set forth on our website. Such fees may include charges for incoming and
                    outgoing transactions, interest charges for completed transactions, and interest charges for seller
                    billing services, which are deducted from the amount paid for the bill.
                    Unless otherwise specified, commissions are automatically deducted from the balance of your wallet
                    at the time the service is provided or completed. Due to its dynamic nature, please refer to
